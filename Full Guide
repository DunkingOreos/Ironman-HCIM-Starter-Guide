		Massing is less rewards but easier and gets Construction XP
		Refer to my Low Level Solo Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD6npZBZOj0&t=3s&ab_channel=DunkingOreos

		If you also did not get any gold bars, then use the one we got from Goblin Diplomacy. Then hope to get more during the wintertodt grind.
		If you need to get 22 Crafting to make necklaces:
			Turn in Dwarf Cannon for Crafting XP (bring Nulodion's Notes & Ammo mould)
			Craft unstrung symbols from any silver bars from caskets
			Cut any uncut sapphires you have
			Do NOT cut opals/jades/red topazes yet as you will break a lot of them

		Sometime in 2024 Varlamore is supposed to release a herbtodt type training method

		It is highly recommended to get 95 RC after completing DS2 in order to efficently level prayer while slaying




*** The next section is a current work in progress and just my thoughts thrown down, I plan to continue development of this section as I work towards doing it in game myself *** 
*** Once the written version is finalized I will go back through and implement it into the other guide so it flows logically and efficently ***
*** Completion of this section ends with DS2 and Perilous Moons - The account will then be ready to explore PvM content where most people will be comfortable ***
*** There WILL be a section on how to get to SoTE but it will NOT be a rush guide like B0aty is making currently ***

		Turn in 200 fruit and then do a birdhouse run until 46 hunter, can continue post 46 but unlocking hunter's guild is a minimum
		Minigame teleport back to Tithe after birdhouse run

	Slayer tasks until ~196,500 xp
		Turiel skipping is advised - 9 tasks at Turiel then 10th at Konar (for points)	
		Getting a RAT task from Turiel is really QOL if you have a friend to help kill Scurrius
			Getting the final hit on Scurrius awards 1069 slayer xp, just dont kill the small rats that spawn in the fight otherwise they decrease your slayer task
		Try to save up points for 'bigger & badder' and 'hot stuff'

	[INV] Your best melee gear, food, prayer potion
	Complete Heart of Darkness
		Trials 1-3 are pretty simple and straight forward
		AFTER YOU CHOOSE THE TRAITOR BE READY FOR A FIGHT
		Trial 4 is a fight against Prince Itzla
			You CANNOT use special attacks because it will auto pray against it
			Pray melee and when he does the sword swipe to smite your prayer, just reactivate your prayers

	Head to Mos' Le Harmless and camp Cave Horrors until you get a black mask 
		If youd like you can unlock the herb sack and seed box from Tithe Farm and swamp to the Arceuus spellbook to reanimate horror heads for 895 prayer xp (4 body, 3 nature, 1 soul rune per reanimation)
		Imbue the mask with scroll

	Compelte Roving Elves
		When finishing the quest choose the shield option
		
	The following miniquests are OPTIONAL and takes you into DEEP MULTICOMBAT WILDERNESS where you can get killed by other players and lose your items
	Complete Mage Arena 1 
		Pretty straight forward just bring blast spells, some prayer potions, some food
		After killing kolidions forms choose a cape and talk to the chamber guardian for a staff aligned with the cape you chose
		Purchase the other 2 staves and collect the other 2 capes
		Cast each god spell 100 times in the arena so that you can use them outside of the arena
			900 Air runes, 700 fire runes, 600 blood runes 
	Complete Mage Arena 2
		If you are not 80 magic yet, highly recommend to get at least 77 before starting and use wizard mind bombs to boost to 80
			Use charge spell to increase max hit of god spells from 20 to 30, increasing overall dps
		Wear full black d hide, god cape/staff, crystal shield, and anything else you are willing to risk, bring prayer potions and food or blighted restores/food from LMS
		If you have food remaining after killing one of the demons, try to locate the next one on your way back to mage bank so that you can min/max your food
		After defeating all 3 demons choose whichever cape youd like to imbue

	OPTIONAL but HIGHLY recommended:
		LMS for rune pouch and msb imbue (80 points)
		My strategy for LMS as someone who is bad at Pking:
			Wait until LMS rotation is on AUS world - everyone will have high ping so it makes it a bit more fair
			Only use range/melee styles - its not as efficent as tribriding but less switches means more focus on eating/praying correctly
			You can setup your inventory at the bank chest in the LMS waiting room
			If you get your first kill when the match starts, try to run to a corner of the map and hide until 9 players remain, then if you can hide until top 4
				Doing this (along with a couple of lucky wins) got me 80 points in 4 hours

	Complete Barrows Chests until you get tank chest and legs (Veracs/Dharoks/Torags/Guthans) 
		If 80+ magic create barrows portal in house for faster way to return
			100,000 coins to make the portal room
			2 limestone bricks for the portal focus, 3 teak planks for teak portal, 200 soul, 100 blood, 200 law runes to make the portal
		If less than 80 magic, after looting chest:
			dueling ring to ferox and drink pool
			ardy cloak to monastary
			fairy ring to BKR
			row to boat and travel to morton (use minigame teleport every 20 minutes)	
		Full rune, air staff + death runes (wind blast), ardy or ma2 cape, barrows gloves, helm of neitznot, rune crossbow with addy/rune bolts (from soulwars) or magic short bow and rune arrows (from LMS)
			Kill Dharok first (pray melee) - use wind blast if hes in the tunnel GL GL
			Kill Ahrims second (pray magic) - use ranged weapons
			Kill Karil third (pray range) - use wind blast
			Kill Guthan, Torag, Verac (no need to pray just eat food) - use wind blast
			Save at least 2 sips of prayer potion for tunnel in case its any of the 3 brothers you need to pray against

	Continue doing slayer tasks until you get another dagganoth task
		I switch from Turiel skipping to using Nieve for 9 tasks and Konar on 10th at this time
	Take 200,000 coins and your Ibans Staff then head to the mage in West Ardougne to imbue (upgrade) your Ibans Staff
		This will give you 2500 charges
	Head to Waterbirth Isle and traverse down into the DKs lair
	Kill Rex in the safespot until Berserker Ring
		Good spot to use your barrows armor here so you can tank the spinolyps, crystal shield optional 
		Ideally you want to get the dragon axe here too but if ring comes first then dont worry about the axe unless you really want to

		If you have the runes/money to spare blood burst is really good here just bring prayer potions, proselyte, ancient staff/ma2 cape and pray melee
		If you want to melee them USE salve amulet as it will work on them (doesnt work with magic unfortunately) 

	Continue slayer tasks until given a Tzharr task - select to slay Jad
		Bring 1500 coins to Keldagrim and talk to Hikro, he will give you a bolt pouch (useful to store multiple bolts with only taking up 1 inventory space)

	OPTIONAL but recommended:
	Complete the Varrock Hard diary
		Purchase the 60 battlestaves every day for 420,000 coins 
		Perilous moons will give you ALOT of water orbs that you can craft and alch each day making 138,000 daily profit
	Complete hunter rumours until you have 10 quetzal feed and make the landing site outside of Perilous Moons with the 10 feed, 4 soft clay, 3 limestone bricks
	
	Welcome to your home for the next 40 or more hours
	Greenlog the Perilous Moons

	Depending on your luck at moons you should have enough prayer banked for level 70 if using sunfire wines and bone shards
	If you don't I would finish off the rest of your xp from killing blue dragons and then turning their bones into shards as well.
		Training Method:
			Chisel your sun-kissed bones straight into bone shards
			Other bones, including the wyrmling bones from moons, youll need to travel to west varlamore and use them on the altar to bless them first.
				Bring all of your bones noted, gp, and a chisel and after blessing chisel them into shards then unnote the bones with Virilis and repeat
			Go to aldarin and buy wines from the bar, you can menu entry swap to get 10 wines per click and the shop never runs out of stock
				You need 1 wine per 400 bone shards
			Equip your blue moon armor and go on the ancient spellbook. You should have dragon weapons in your inventory with some food and a 1 click teleport 
				Go to the colosseum and farm wave 1 for sunfire splinters
				You need 2 splinters per 1 wine
				Combine your splinters with your wines to make sunfire wines
			[INV] rune pouch with runes to varlamore, bone shards, 26 sunfire wines (have a dueling ring equipped)
				Teleport to Varlamore and quetzal back to the altar
				Bless your sunfire wines
				Go to the liberation pool and spam click until out of prayer points then recharge prayer at the altar
				Dueling ring out, refill inventory, repeat	

	[INV] (Equip full eclipse with avas) Full blood moon with fire cape, dragon dagger, full blue moon armor with an air staff (pre twin flame), super str/attack potion, 2-4 prayer potions (lower if you have giant soul amulet),
		ardy cloak, dueling ring, runes for water and fire wave, some food.		
	Head over to the Royal Titans to get at least the prayer scrolls, ideally youll also get the twinflame staff
		Going dry here isn't bad at all, the main drops from the bosses are VERY good for mid game (seeds/herbs/ALOT of alchs)
		Getting the giantsoul amulet is the most QOL part of this because you wont need to use prayer potions anymore, you can tele out to the monastary after each kill and teleport back
			Recharge your amulet by killing giant frogs in the lumbridge swamp for big bones, or bring duplicate amulets to the rag and bone man

5. The Final Push 	
	
	[INV] Granite, runes for telegrab, full black armor, bronze medium helm, iron chainbody, teleports to ardy/camelot, ardy cloak and lunar staff

	The Sins of the Father questline is lengthy but offers AMAZING rewards including:
		over 100k xp in tomes (can be used on herblore)
		a cannonable area for bloodvelds (one of the best slayer xp areas in the game)
		ability to pickpocket or kill vyres to get blood shards
		woodcutting method on blisterwood tree

	Complete Darkness of Hallowvale (8 nails, 2 planks, hammer, knife, tele grab, pickaxe, food)
		When you are sketching the sides of the castle, the south-eastern portion (last one you sketch if using quest helper) will trigger Vanstrom Klause to attack - Similiar to Legends Quest - you MUST pray melee BEFORE sketching this part.
	
	Complete A Taste of Hope (1,000 coins, knife, emerald, chisle, runes for lvl-2 enchant, pickaxe, food)
		The abomination fight can be safespotted by running out of the area and along the wall to the East. Use magic to kill it.
		Ranis Drakan: Black d hide top/bottom, climbing boots, barrows gloves, power amulet, helm of neitznot, fire cape, flail, dragon defender, berserker ring. Sharks/bwans for food, 2 prayer potions. Drink super att/str/def before the fight
			Phase 1 - Pray mage and piety, step back after each attack and wait to hit him as hes doing his magic attack so you dont even take melee hits. When he starts shaking youll need to keep running away
				Around 60% he'll call 2 guards to help. Pray melee and watch Ranis, when he throws a bomb move one tile so it hits the vyre instead of you.
			Phase 2 - Pray mage and piety, step back after each attack and wait to hit him as hes doing his magic attack so you dont even take melee hits. When he starts shaking youll need to keep running away
				Around 20% he'll call 2 guards to help. Pray melee and watch Ranis, when he throws a bomb move one tile so it hits the vyre instead of you.
			Phase 3 - Pray melee and piety. He can hit through prayer so make sure to pay attention to HP
	
	Complete Sins of the Father(axe, 1,950 coins to purchase the vyre outfit, flail, ruby, knife, chisel, runes for lvl-3 enchant)
		ALL fights will utilize the following gear: Black d hide top/bottom, climbing boots, barrows gloves, power amulet, helm of neitznot, fire cape, dragon defender, berserker ring. (You can use any weapon on Kroy, but need flail for other fights)
		Kroy - Pray mage and watch out for the thrown vials, just step back when its thrown.
		Damien - Pray mage and stomp fires whenever they spawn.
		
		Vanstrom Klause - Go through the entire cutscene an the teleport out and gear up. This is because the initial cutscene is 2 minutes long which reduces your boosted stats.
			If you use 117 HD...TURN IT OFF. It messes with the fight and you can sometimes miss when the attack happens of him saying stare into darkness and get hit for like 50 damage. 
				Another good way to mitigate this attack is after you hit him always step 1 tile away so youre not facing him.
			The biggest help in my opinion is to make a topaz ring and enchant it, creating the Efaritay's aid. This gives you a 15% increase in accuracy which absolutely helped me in my fight. 
			From the wiki: " Even with around 80 Attack, the Piety prayer, and super attack potions, you still only have around a 60-65% chance to hit Vanstrom with the flail". So using the ring brings it up to 75-80% meaning more dps

			Inventory:
			sara brews if you have them, try to bring around 6-9 but if you hit really good you can get away with using 3. 

			I brought rune pouch with wind wave, 3 sara brews 1 restore, 10 sharks, 9 bwans, 1 click tele out, 2 prayer potions, berserker ring switch when efaritays aid breaks (mine did not break so this could be used for an extra piece of food). 
			I finished the fight with all 3 sara brews, restore, 1 shark, 1 bwan remaining.


			Fight:
			When pre-potting, go to ferox and eat a blighted anglerfish to boost your hp, then drink super att/str/def
			Drakon medallion back to TOB bank then run to the island to talk to safallan and start the fight

			Phase 1:
			Pray piety and protect from magic the entire time
			When he says stare into darkness, FACE AWAY from him
			When he says blood will be my strength, he spawns a blood orb. Walk over to it BUT BE CAREFUL because even though it looks small its actually a 3x3 area so make sure to run a few tiles around it then stand in line with it in the furthest corner you can get and vanstrom will walk into it dealing alot of damage to him (very very helpful for dps)
			When he spawns his bloodveld thing use wind blast on it to kill it. 


			Phase 2:
			Take off protect from magic but contine to pray piety
			Attack him and watch out for the lightning on the ground. 
			This is going to be the dps check of the fight and a major reason why Efaritay's aid is so worth it, though it does come down to RNG of your hits. I used 3 shark 3 bwans during this phase. 


	Complete Regicide (25+ coal, bow/arrows, 2 ropes, spade, limestone (not brick) or pickaxe, tbox, 4 balls of wool, p&m, gloves, pot, axe)
		Create extra barrel of Naphtha for MEP1
	Complete Roving Elves (Glarial's pebble, key, spade, rope, lots of food)
		Bow is good for completing the diary step
		Shield is good for fight caves and general tanking
		Start MEP1 with Eluned immediately afterwards to unlock Lletya
	Complete Mourning's End Part I (bear fur, 2 silk, red/yellow/green/blue dyes, bucket of water, feather, rotten apple, premade t'd crunch, magic logs, leather, ogre bellows, barrel of naphtha)
	Complete Mourning's End Part II (mourner gear, chisel, rope, catalytic talisman or item list)
		HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting Catalytic Talisman from GoTR (it will act as a death talisman)

	THE TIME HAS COME.

	Complete Song of the Elves (steel full helm/platebody/platelegs, red/purple dye, mourner gear with gasmask, silk, runite bar (can get 1 from rune dragons or opening crystal chest), 8 limestone bricks, tinderbox, rope, nature rune, irit leaf
				   adamant chainbody (can buy in falador but normally sold out, either get one on an alt account to sell to store, hop to f2p worlds, or wait until reset day), wine of zamorak, cabbage (cannont be from draynor manner), 
				   black knife or dagger, cadatine seed, vial of water, pestle and mortar, hammer, saw, pickaxe, axe, spade)

		There is ALOT of running around in this quest so just be patient with it. 
		Your first batch of fighting is really easy at this point of your account, just kill the mourners and knights bring some cheese potato if youd like but I wouldnt waste prayer potions here.
		The library part SUCKS. Thank God for quest helper
		When killing the guards at the Iorworth camp trap the melee elf behind the ranger, similiar to how you trap the guard from Tourist Trap. 
			This way you can just pray range and deal with the ranger then pray melee and deal with the meleer 1v1
		As you return to Lleyta have Eluned enchant your teleport crystal -- you will NOT be able to do this in the upcoming portions of the quest
		
		BEFORE talking to Ysgawyn make sure you have your combat gear (blood moon is good), potions, food 
			Ariawyn Fight: Really simple fight just pray range and watch for the orange colored arrow - youll need to step back 1 tile so it doesnt explode on you
	
		You can pull out graceful while going all around and collecting the clues/talking to people but before you talk to Lady Mellyr regear (blood moon, food, potions)
			Defending the Dwarven Camp: 4 minute "fight" where you just have to make sure the barrier isnt destroyed. Attack the elves that are attacking the barrier to pull their aggro to you. Just pray melee and eat food.
			Essyllt Fight: pray melee, when you get pushed back from the spear immediately pray range (can hit up to 51 if you dont pray) the potions that are thrown will reduce your stats but it'll never drop below -5 so dont even worry about this part	
		

		Fragment of Seren Fight:
			Blood blitz, Blue moon armor, god cape, barrows gloves, best amulet/boots/ring you have (i used power ammy/jester boots/beacon ring)
			[INV] knives, tuna potato/karambwan, 2-3 sara brews, 3-4 restore potions (I used 10 sips of restore, 4 sips of sara brew, 6 tuna potato 6 karambwans)
				I had 6 sips of restore, 6 sips of sara brew, 4 tuna potato and 2 karambwans 77 hp left when i finished the quest

			Pray mystic vigour and protect range the entire time

			Seren attacks with ranged and every 15 seconds will perform a special attack in a static pattern.
			1st Special: Teleports you close to her and will melee. Simply spam click away when being teleported to avoid damage.
			2nd Special: Spawns clones and you need to attack the light colored one (quest helper will highlight the correct one for you).
			3rd Special: Pillars will spawn healing Seren, use your knives to do damage quickly. BE CARFEFUL when running around killing the pillars to not get into melee range of Seren
			4th Special: Seren will freeze you in place and launch an attack that does damage based off of your HP level (this can kill you if you are below max hitpoints) simply eat to full hp, over eat with a sara brew if you want, or pray redemption 
				IF YOU PRAY REDEMPTION YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE AT FULL HP AS THIS IS RISKIER THAN JUST OVER EATING.

			As the fight goes on the special attacks "evolve"
			1st Special - You'll have less time to react to the attack, but spam clicking away as you get pulled in will work just fine
			2nd Special - No real change since quest helper will highlight the correct one
			3rd Special - More pillars spawn which heal Seren, so the lower her HP the more DPS you need to be able to out put otherwise she'll just keep healing
			4th Special - The max damage is increased. Dont even worry about the calculations just always get to or above your max HP.
