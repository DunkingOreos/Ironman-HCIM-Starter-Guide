2A. Tempoross

	Go to Tempoross until 200 permits should be around 58 Fishing. Raise kittens in the process.
		Looking to get sapphire necklaces here, anything else is bonus
		Food from 200 permits will suffice for quests 
		Soloing will not get you any Construction XP but will get more rewards
		Massing is less rewards but easier and gets Construction XP
		Refer to my Low Level Solo Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD6npZBZOj0&t=3s&ab_channel=DunkingOreos
		
	After Tempoross grind - Buy 1 inventory of bronze bars (there is a Shantay shop at Tempoross)
	
	If you did not get any sapphire necklaces from Tempoross caskets, craft up to 10 of them
		If you also did not get any gold bars, don't craft any at this time and skip going to Mage Bank for now
		If you need to get 22 Crafting to make necklaces:
			Turn in Dwarf Cannon for Crafting XP (bring Nulodion's Notes & Ammo mould)
			Cut any uncut sapphires you have
			Craft tiaras from any silver bars from caskets
			Do NOT cut opals/jades/red topazes yet as you will break a lot of them

2B. Wintertodt
	
		Go to Wintertodt until you get 12 magic logs. Raise kittens in the process.
			Save crates until 75 firemaking (This should get you to 60 woodcutting and 75 FM is the highest requirement for QPC)
				If you dont get 12 magic logs from this big opening, continue and open after each kc 
			If you really want to, you can stay until 99 
			Soloing: slower kc (~1 hour each), more rolls/hr, more construction/fletching/woodcutting xp
			Massing: Faster/easier kc, more firemaking xp/hr
