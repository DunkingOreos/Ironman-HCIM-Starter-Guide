Death on the isle (varlamore pt 2 quest) before doing fruit stalls/varrock theiving 

Ethically acquired antiquities (varlamore pt 2 quest) after death on the isle

Draynor agility course is now available at level 1 agility - no longer need to do gnome stronghold 

Look into buying lizard kicker pot from shayzien (+4 range bonus to not train range for spirits of elid) - this worked well though we still will eventually need ranged training

gather limpwurts at giants foundry area for quicker banking instead of edge dungeon

orange dye from shayzien - minor time save if any since we gather and make the dyes for other quests anyways

add barely planting early on into the guide part 1B - 2 barley malt are needed for forgettable tale (protect with 3 compost)

remove purchasing of 12 wizard mind bombs - theyre not used. 

remove need for kwuarm/red spider eggs/vial from ratcatchers & remove getting kwuarm from hill giants. (Getting rat poison from clock tower portion satisfies this requirement)

graceful might not been needed as early on in the account, huge time save - though still need 60 agility post rfd for other quests
  Need 48 for ARF awowogei --> can get to 40 through questing. Tourist trap = 9300, recruitment drive, underground pass, icthalrins helper, grand tree, death on the isle, troll romance
  skips need for varrock course could still use lamp from ardy easy to get to 41 
    40-48 takes 2.3 hours
    41-48 takes 2.1 hours so recommend to save lamp for something else
