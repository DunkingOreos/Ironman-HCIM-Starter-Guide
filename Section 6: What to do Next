*** The next section is a current work in progress and just my thoughts thrown down, I plan to continue development of this section as I work towards doing it in game myself *** 
*** Once the written version is finalized I will go back through and implement it into the other guide so it flows logically and efficently ***
*** Completion of this section ends with DS2 and Perilous Moons - The account will then be ready to explore PvM content where most people will be comfortable ***
*** There WILL be a section on how to get to SoTE but it will NOT be a rush guide like B0aty is making currently ***

		Once youve killed Nezikchened for the final time talk to goju and teleport back to legends' guild to finish the quest
		XP rewards into Herblore and you should now be at level 55. From here on out, train herblore organically by keeping up with herb runs. We will eventually need to get lvl 70 for SOTE

		Can be done whenever but the sooner the better so we can begin farming contracts for seeds and hespori for bottomless compost bucket
		Turn in 200 fruit and then do a birdhouse run until 46 hunter, can continue post 46 but unlocking hunter's guild is a minimum
		Minigame teleport back to Tithe after birdhouse run
		25x4 method is better and doesnt require any sweaty diagonal running or seed dibber animation skipping (see the tile markers listed below)
