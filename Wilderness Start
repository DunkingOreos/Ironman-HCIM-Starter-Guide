	[INV] Looting bag, 3 wine

	[INV] Chronicle, 10 gp, all steel platelegs noted
	Tele home and run to Al Kharid plateleg shop
	Sell one at a time for 650 gp each (buy on another account so you dont have to world hop)
	Chronicle tele and buy 3500 - 4500 water strikes 
		About 50 casts per kc depending on if you have to world hop towards end of kill and such
		Took 3,087 casts for 60 bones
	
	[INV] Looting bag, water and mind runes
	Kill lava dragons for either 40 or 43 prayer (use alt to tele from Ferox to lvl 35 obelisk for dragons, then lvl 44 obelisk for chaos altar)
		First hour will average  ~ 15 kc
		Susequent hours average  ~ 22 kc
	
		If you dont want to risk lava dragons there are a couple of other options:
			Safespot green dragons north of Ferox
				Will be slightly safer than lavas but significantly slower (took 200 casts and 11 minutes 20 seconds for first kill, lava dragons are 2 minutes 30-40 seconds for first kills)
			Run to the boneyard and collect 355 big bones (40 prayer) or 480 big bones (43 prayer) 
	    			While this sounds slow, realize that killing lava dragons will take about 3-5 hours depending if going to 40 or 43 prayer
				You will use some wines here while running through the skeletons
				Doesnt get you magic xp which means more time spent at revs
					If skipping revs you can winterdot will be easier since less HP
		
	If you get 40 Prayer, completing Recruitment Drive, Priest in Peril, and Holy Grail will get you 43
			40 Prayer takes 61 bones at Chaos altar
			43 Prayer takes 85 bones at Chaos altar
				50 gp each to unnote, bring gp accordingly
		If you get these drops, keep at least one: Rune axe, lava battlestaff, nature taslisman (RDT but could be used in Fairytale pt 1) 
		Keep ALL rune knives (will be used to skip yew bow requirement during Temple of Ikov)
			Alch the rest after 52+ Magic
	Go get slayer task from Krystilia
		Fingers crossed for revs, if not then don't worry about completing it
	Kill revs until 60 magic (skull on alt) 
		Although a rev weapon or relic would be amazing, the most important thing to get here is magic logs so we can skip WT
			If unlucky and no magic logs before 60 magic, get magic logs through hunter rumours unless you want to do WT
		Do NOT high alch extra braclets until 60 magic (in case rev weapon drop) - put 1 ether in to make it 45k per bracelet
		Start at goblins until money permits the maintenance of chaos or death runes
	At 60 magic go do Mage Arena 1
		At this time also buy 20 - 100 cosmic runes depending on money
