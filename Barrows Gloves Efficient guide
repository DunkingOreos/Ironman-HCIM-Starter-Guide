This guide takes reference between the 'Optimal Ironman Quest Guide' from the Wiki & Runelite in addition to the "Bofa Rush Ironman v1.4 by Kirbuti (last update: 28 July 2023)". 
	Kirbuti did an amazing job constantly updating the guide with new information about things that were reworked over the years.
As of June 2024 I have updated this even further while completing it on my current HCIM and then once more after the guide was finalized.


Shameless plugs:

	twitch.tv/Dunking_Oreos

	[insert youtube video link] I created a video version of this guide 


Setup/General notes:
	This guide is designed to prioritize obtaining Barrows Gloves and then offers paths for DS2 and SoTE.
		Average completion of Barrows Gloves through this guide is 105 hours.
		It is recommended to use the Quest Helper and Shortest Path plugins throughout this guide.
		Not meant to be a speedrun and is more so a route of getting items and doing quests in a logically efficient manner.
	XP lamps dont have to be used on anything specific - herblore is recommended if the goal is to max
		Herblore training isnt as hard as it used to be snf dometime in 2024 Varlamore is supposed to release a herbtodt type training method 
		I also normally do the UIM method of getting dream vials, 1k vials = 168k herb xp 
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-02vi8wjrAE&ab_channel=Radishboy
	While runecrafting is regarded to be one of the worse skills in the game, GoTR has made this skill exponentially better. 
		It is highly recommended to get 95 RC after completing DS2 in order to efficently level prayer while slaying

	Set up a new account through the Jagex Launcher.
		This is required in order to claim 10k from Stronghold of Security
		If you dont want to use Jagex Launcher, get the 10k by picking up steel platelegs in the wilderness and selling to leg shop in Al Kharid


	[INV] Indicates inventory setups throughout the guide
		A vast majority of the combat in this guide will utilize magic as the combat reblance in May 2024 has made magic even stronger
		Using mind runes and and air staff will be the primary method of DPS until enough kittens are grown for a stockpile of death runes.


	
ALTERNATE START -- If you do not want to go to the wilderness and risk status skip to line 104
	
	In Lumbridge, sell to general store: bronze weapons, bronze axe, wooden shield, shortbow
	Buy spade and hammer from general store
	Drop air/mind runes, claim more from tutor
	Start X Marks the Spot
	Minigame tele to Burthrope and get slayer task
	Home tele

	[INV] Bread, shrimps
	Use Count Check's one-time teleport to Barbarian Village
	Go north to hall, take one piece of cooked beef and burn it
	Pick up more food spawns in hall (hop worlds for extra, shouldn't need more than 5)
	Stronghold of Security Floors 1-3 for 10k gp
	Go buy black wizard hat from Port Sarim
	Go to Draynor and buy 54 wines, chronicle, 5 teleport cards
	Chronicle tele rune to Aubury and buy 100 water/earth/fire and 500 mind runes
	Run to Zaff and buy air staff
	Do slayer task until minigame tele is ready
	Minigame tele to LMS and go east to kill rats for looting bag
	
	[INV] Looting bag, 3 wine
	Collect 4 inventories steel platelegs (will net ~140k) run back and forth to Ferox on f2p worlds (no green dragons spawn)
	
	[INV] Chronicle, 10 gp, all steel platelegs noted
	Tele home and run to Al Kharid plateleg shop
	Sell one at a time for 650 gp each (buy on another account so you dont have to world hop)
	Chronicle tele and buy 3500 - 4500 water strikes 
		About 50 casts per kc depending on if you have to world hop towards end of kill and such
		Took 3,087 casts for 60 bones
	
	[INV] Looting bag, water and mind runes
	Kill lava dragons for either 40 or 43 prayer (use alt to tele from Ferox to lvl 35 obelisk for dragons, then lvl 44 obelisk for chaos altar)
		First hour will average  ~ 15 kc
		Susequent hours average  ~ 22 kc
	
		If you dont want to risk lava dragons there are a couple of other options:
			Safespot green dragons north of Ferox
				Will be slightly safer than lavas but significantly slower (took 200 casts and 11 minutes 20 seconds for first kill, lava dragons are 2 minutes 30-40 seconds for first kills)
			Run to the boneyard and collect 355 big bones (40 prayer) or 480 big bones (43 prayer) 
	    			While this sounds slow, realize that killing lava dragons will take about 3-5 hours depending if going to 40 or 43 prayer
				You will use some wines here while running through the skeletons
				Doesnt get you magic xp which means more time spent at revs
					If skipping revs you can winterdot will be easier since less HP
		
	If you get 40 Prayer, completing Recruitment Drive, Priest in Peril, and Holy Grail will get you 43
			40 Prayer takes 61 bones at Chaos altar
			43 Prayer takes 85 bones at Chaos altar
				50 gp each to unnote, bring gp accordingly
		If you get these drops, keep at least one: Rune axe, lava battlestaff, nature taslisman (RDT but could be used in Fairytale pt 1) 
		Keep ALL rune knives (will be used to skip yew bow requirement during Temple of Ikov)
			Alch the rest after 52+ Magic
	Go get slayer task from Krystilia
		Fingers crossed for revs, if not then don't worry about completing it
	Kill revs until 60 magic (skull on alt) 
		Although a rev weapon or relic would be amazing, the most important thing to get here is magic logs so we can skip WT
			If unlucky and no magic logs before 60 magic, get magic logs through hunter rumours unless you want to do WT
		Do NOT high alch extra braclets until 60 magic (in case rev weapon drop) - put 1 ether in to make it 45k per bracelet
		Start at goblins until money permits the maintenance of chaos or death runes
	At 60 magic go do Mage Arena 1
		At this time also buy 20 - 100 cosmic runes depending on money
