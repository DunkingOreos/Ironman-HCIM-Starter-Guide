## Setup/General notes:
    This guide is designed to prioritize obtaining Barrows Gloves and then offers paths for DS2 and SoTE.
      Average completion of Barrows Gloves through this guide is 100 hours.
      It is recommended to use the Quest Helper and Shortest Path plugins throughout this guide.
      Not meant to be a speedrun and is more so a route of getting items and doing quests in a logically efficient manner.

    Set up a new account through the Jagex Launcher.
      This is required in order to claim 10k from Stronghold of Security
      If you dont want to use Jagex Launcher: 
      Pick up at least 15 steel platelegs in the wilderness and sell to leg shop in Al Kharid one per world.

    [INV] Indicates inventory setups throughout the guide
    A vast majority of the combat in this guide will utilize magic due to the combat reblance in May 2024.
    Air strike will be the primary method of DPS until enough kittens are grown for a stockpile of death runes.
